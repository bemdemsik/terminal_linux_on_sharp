          [-F separator] [-f namefile] [-m magicfiles] [-P name=value]
          file ...
     file -C [-m magicfiles]
     file [--help]
DESCRIPTION        
     This manual page documents version 5.43 of the file command.

     file tests each argument in an attempt to classify it.  There are
     three sets of tests, performed in this order: filesystem tests,
     magic tests, and language tests.  The first test that succeeds
     causes the file type to be printed.
-b
             Do not prepend filenames to output lines (brief mode).
-f
             Read the names of the files to be examined from namefile
             (one per line) before the argument list.  Either namefile
             or at least one filename argument must be present; to test
             the standard input, use ‘-’ as a filename argument.  Please
             note that namefile is unwrapped and the enclosed filenames
             are processed when this option is encountered and before
             any further options processing is done.  This allows one to
             process multiple lists of files with different command line
             arguments on the same file invocation.  Thus if you want to
             set the delimiter, you need to do it before you specify the
             list of files, like: “-F @ -f namefile”, instead of: “-f
             namefile -F @”.
-k
             Don't stop at the first match, keep going.  Subsequent
             matches will be have the string ‘\012- ’ prepended.  (If
             you want a newline, see the -r option.)  The magic pattern
             with the highest strength (see the -l option) comes first.
--help, -h  Print a help message and exit.
