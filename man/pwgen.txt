NAME
	pwgen - random password generator

SYNOPSIS
	pwgen [OPTION]... [password length]

DESCRIPTION
	The pwgen program generates passwords which are designed to be easily memorized by humans, 
	while being as secure as possible. Human-memorable passwords are never going to be as 
	secure as completely completely random passwords. In particular, passwords generated by 
	pwgen without the -s option should not be used in places where the password could be 
	attacked via an off-line brute-force attack. On the other hand, completely randomly generated 
	passwords have a tendency to be written down, and are subject to being compromised in that fashion.

OPTIONS
	-s
		generate a completely random password
	
	-y
		containing at least one special character

	-v
		Generate random passwords that do not contain vowels or numbers that might be mistaken for 
		vowels. It provides less secure passwords to allow system administrators to not have to 
		worry with random passwords accidentally contain offensive substrings.

	-h
		help in using the command
