NAME         
       grep - print lines that match patterns
SYNOPSIS        
       grep [OPTION...] PATTERNS [FILE...]
       grep [OPTION...] -e PATTERNS ... [FILE...]
       grep [OPTION...] -f PATTERN_FILE ... [FILE...]
DESCRIPTION         
       grep searches for PATTERNS in each FILE.  PATTERNS is one or more
       patterns separated by newline characters, and grep prints each
       line that matches a pattern.  Typically PATTERNS should be quoted
       when grep is used in a shell command.

       A FILE of “-” stands for standard input.  If no FILE is given,
       recursive searches examine the working directory, and
       nonrecursive searches read standard input.
-i
              Ignore case distinctions in patterns and input data, so
              that characters that differ only in case match each other.
--help, -h 
		Output a usage message and exit.
-n
              Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line number
              within its input file.
-v
              Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching
              lines.
